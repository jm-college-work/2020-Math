# RUNNING THE SOFTWARE
	To start an instance of the program,
	open the exe folder and run "MainProject_2020.exe".

# USING THE APP
	The application loads into the main menu.
	Select one of the 4 options to begin.
	
	From the main menu, if an invalid option is enetered,
	the menu will be shown and an error will appear.

	After chosing a correct main menu option, the app will enter
	a "sub-menu" where you can input the variable(s) required 
	for each specific mathematical operation.
	
	The app does not perform input validation, so please enter
	integers for the inputs.
	
	After performing the required mathematical operation, the app 
	will offer the option to return to the main menu or perform 
	the same operation again with new variables.
	
	To exit the app, close the console window or type 0 from the
	main menu.
